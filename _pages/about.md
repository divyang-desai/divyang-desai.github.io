Hey, I'm **Divyang Desai**

I'm a programmer with over 6 years of experience, having worked in various areas, extensive in the Microsoft technology stack. 

I love learning new things; my focus right now is ASP.NET Core and Blockchain. I work remotely from  Ahmedabad, IN.  

I blog about things I learned or find interesting during work and side projects. You can send me an email at *desai[dot]divyang16[at]gmail.com*
